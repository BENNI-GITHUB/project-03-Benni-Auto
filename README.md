## Design
### Overall Feel

For this project I wanted to have a light feel to emulate a light-time setting. 

### Color Scheme
![color scheme](./documentation/readme-view/collor_pallet.jpg)

### Typography

There were two font that I was interested in for the site: 
- [Signika Negative](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Signika+Negative?preview.text=Benni%20Auto&query=Signika+Negative) by [Google-Font](https://fonts.google.com/) fit perfectly with the light theme of website. 
- also Sans-Serif is used as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

### Imagery

Imagery is an important part of the user experience.  for this website I used three types of images:
- Graphic photo which is used for the main page photo and describes the purpose of the website
- Vector image which is used in main page and for service section. it is edited and adopted to website color theme. 
- real images which are used in service page to describe each service. 

## Wireframes
### Wireframes
All Wireframes were designed for laptop/computer, iPad/tablet and phone display.
Wireframes were produced using Balsamiq.

# Features
## Current Features
### **Navigation menu displayed across all pages**

The navigation menu will help the user move easily across all pages.
The navigation buttons update depending on whether a user is logged in, and whether that user is the admin:

| Nav Link              |Not logged in  |Logged in as user|Logged in as admin
|:-------------         |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |
|Logo(back to home)     |&#9989;        |&#9989;        |&#9989;
|Home                   |&#9989;        |&#9989;        |&#9989;
|Services               |&#9989;        |&#9989;        |&#9989;
|Contact                |&#9989;        |&#9989;        |&#9989;

|Log Out                |&#10060;       |&#9989;        |&#9989;
|Book Now               |&#9989;(login) |&#9989;        |&#9989;

### **All Services and reviews are accessible to users who don't want to make an account**

As someone who doesn't particularly like to sign up to websites there is possibility to see the services and their contents and the reviews page too. 

### **Reviews**

Anyone can see the usersâ€™ reviews. the reviews are included title of review, Rating, Description, and the username of the user who wrote that. 
The last three written reviews appear in the home page. but for writing a review the users have to login first. the reviews are sorted by date created and user can see the date of review.


### **User account management**

Anyone can make an account through the 'Register' page. They must choose a username and a password. Measures have been put in place so that the user cannot choose a username or email that is already taken.
Also, users are asked to re-write their password to confirm they wrote it right. even they can click on eye icon to unveil the password if needed. 


### **User orders management**

  + **Adding**: A registered users can book service order to the orders page on their own names. Once they have order that they have added, all order management can be accessible there. This includes editing or canceling them. These orders can be shown just for Admin and the owner of the service orders. in order request form, the users must determine the requested services and the brand of their car from the options.
  Also, the users are asked to choose the appointment date. if the users need the recovery service to pick up their car, they must switch on the need recovery icon. as soon as the need recovery switched on, the users must fill their address. 

  + **Editing**: The user will have to go into the edit order page through the order page, make the necessary changes and confirm them at the bottom of the page. The user also has the option to cancel all changes. These steps assure that the user cannot do any of this by mistake.

  + **Canceling**: when the order placed, the users have option to cancel their order by submitting the cancel description. After the order requested to be canceled, at the top row of the order the word "Canceled" will be shown up.
 
### **User reviews management**

  + **Adding**: A registered users can leave a comment for the services. they can rate it from 1 star to 5 stars. and describe and share their experience with others. 

  + **Deleting**: Only the user who owns that written comment can delete it. By pressing the delete button the confirmation box will be shown up and after clicking the delete button again the review will be deleted permanently. this gives the users another chance to change the process if they click the button by mistake.  

### **Admin 'Services' management**

Only the admin can manage the Services pages. This includes adding, editing, and deleting. The site has been designed so that the admin only must use the Services management page to create a new Service at this will automatically be updated on the services page and also an element in home page with the service title. Any edits or deletions to services will also apply to those elements. 

### **Admin 'Orders' management**

Only the admin can delete the Service Orders in orders pages. in some circumstances if the users request the owner to change or cancel any order, the admin can cancel or edit them. 

### **Admin 'Reviews' management**

Admin does not have any option to delete or edit any reviews. this right gives the users to make their decision fairly.


## Possible Future Features
+ Calculating the average rates for each services according to the user rates. 
+ Create a new page for each service to describe more.
+ Create a search option for the visitors to redirect to the specific item they want to visit. 
+ Create a profile page for the users to manage their previous activities in one page. 
+ Adding an option for users to change their password or even retrieve their profile if they forget their password.

# Testing
Due to the size of the testing section, I have created a separate document for it. You can find it [here](https://github.com/BENNI-GITHUB/project-03-Benni-Auto/blob/main/TESTING.md).

# Deployment

## Heroku Deployment
This project was deployed through Heroku using the following steps:

### Requirements and Procfile
Heroku needs to know which technologies are being used and any requirements, so I created files to let it know. Before creating the Heroku app, create these files using the following steps in GitPod: 
+ In the GitPod terminal, type ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` to create your requirements file.
+ In the GitPod terminal, type ```echo web: python run.py > Procfile``` to create your Procfile.
+ The Procfile needs to contain the following line: ```web: python app.py``` and make sure there is no additional blank line after it. 
+ Push these files to your repository.

### Environmental File

Create and env.py file using the following information:

```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", *unique secret key* )
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "postgresql:///*database name*")
```


Because this contains sensitive information, this needs to be added to the '.gitignore' file. 

### Creating Heroku App
+ Log into Heroku
+ Select 'Create New App' from your dashboard
+ Choose an app name (if there has been an app made with that name, you will be informed and will need to choose an alternative)
+ Select the appropriate region based on your location
+ Click 'Create App'
### Connecting to GitHub
+ From the dashboard, click the 'Deploy' tab towards the top of the screen
+ From here, locate 'Deployment Method' and choose 'GitHub'
+ From the search bar newly appeared, locate your repository by name
+ When you have located the correct repository, click 'Connect'
+ DO NOT CLICK 'ENABLE AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENT': This can cause unexpected errors before configuration. We'll come back to this
+ Click the 'Settings' tab towards the top of the page
+ Locate the 'Config Vars' and click 'Reveal Config Vars'
+ Use the following keys and values which must match the key/value pairs in your env.py file:

    | KEY | VALUE |
    | :-- | :-- |
    | IP | 0.0.0.0 |
    | PORT | 5000 |
    | SECRET_KEY | MY_SECRET_KEY* |
    | DB_URL | postgresql:///*database name* |
    | DEBUG | TRUE** |


+ Go back to the 'Deploy' tab and you can now click 'Enable Automatic Deployment'
+ Underneath, locate 'Manual Deploy'; choose the master branch and click 'Deploy Branch'
+ Once the app is built (it may take a few minutes), click 'Open App' from the top of the page

## Forking the Repository
+ Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
+ At the top of the Repository above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
+ You will have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
+ You will now be able to make changes to the new version and keep the original safe. 
## Making a Local Clone
+ Log into GitHub.
+ Locate the repository.
+ Click the 'Code' dropdown above the file list.
+ Copy the URL for the repository.
+ Open Git Bash on your device.
+ Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
+ Type ```git clone``` in the CLI and then paste the URL you copied earlier. This is what it should look like:
  + ```$ git clone https://github.com/BENNI-GITHUB/project-03-Benni-Auto```
+ Press Enter to create your local clone.

You will also need to install all of the packages listed in the requirements file you can use the following command in the terminal ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` which will do it for you.
