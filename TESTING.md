## Validator Testing
### **HTML**

 I checked all of the HTML pages using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

 Because the code is made up of Jinja templates, I had to check from the live site by right clicking each page, selecting View Page Source and running that generated code through the validator.

 All pages passed all checks. 

### **CSS**

I checked the CSS file using [W3C CSS Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

Unfortunately, it returned 3 errors:

![css validator results](static/images/README/validator-css.PNG)

All the errors were in relation to the ```backdrop-filter: blur``` property that it claims doesn't exist. However, according to [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter) this is a valid property. 

There are some compatbilty issues with Firefox which I've documented in the [manual testing section](#manually-testing-functionality). 

Other than that, any other warnings were related to the vendor prefixes. 

### **JavaScript**

I checked the script.js file using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

The only issues coming back from JS Validator were two unused functions:

![js validator results](static/images/README/validator-js.PNG)

However, both of these functions are called throughout the site:

![js validator results](static/images/README/validator-js-02.PNG)

![js validator results](static/images/README/validator-js-03.PNG)

### **Python**
I checked the app.py file using [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/)

The code passed all checks.

### **Performance**

+ Convert all images to webp format

### **Accessibility**

+ Footer h4 changed to h1
+ Add alt tags to all images
+ Add title to all links
+ Place side nav header into li

### **Best Practices**
+ Add ```rel="nopener"``` to all external links

### **SEO**
+ Add meta description

All of these changes helped bring the final score up nicely. While I would have like a higher performance score(preferably in the green) but overall, I'm happy with the progress.

## PowerMapper Compatibility

I used [PowerMapper](https://www.powermapper.com/) to test cross-browser compatbility on other browsers that I don't have access to.

![powermapper results](static/images/README/powermapper-01.PNG)

According to their site, the ```backdrop-filter``` property had some browser compatibility issues:
![powermapper results](static/images/README/powermapper-02.PNG)

I manually checked all of the browsers specified(apart from Internet Explorer) and found that, apart from Firefox, the ```backdrop-filter``` property did work:

![safari blur](static/images/README/safari-backdrop-blur.png)
![ios blur](static/images/README/ios-backdrop-blur.png)

Firefox definitely doesn't support the property so I manually tested it to make sure that, even without the blur filter, the site still looked okay and the text was legible

![firefox blur](static/images/README/firefox-blur.png)
![firefox blur](static/images/README/firefox-blur-02.png)
![firefox blur](static/images/README/firefox-blur-03.PNG)

While it would be great to have the blur included, I still think that the look of the site holds up on firefox and all text remains legible.

## Testing From User Stories

### As a casual user: 
+ *I want to be able to view services without having to register and account.*

Even without being logged in, a user is able to browse through all the service cards:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-01.png)

---

+ *I want to see all the reviews.*

The review page gives the user the ability to evaluate the quality of services from other users view, especially for the service they want to request:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-03.png)


---

+ *I want to have the option to register an account if I want to come back at a later date.*

From the navigation bar, the user can go to the Login/Register page. From there, If they dont have an account they can choose a register link and then by filling the register form with a unique username and email:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-04.png)
![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-05.png)

 If their chosen username or email has already been taken, they will be informed consequency and can choose another:

 ![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-05-a.png)
 ![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-05-b.png)


 If their chosen password is not same as the confirmed password, they will be notified to try again to fix it:
 ![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-05-c.png)


If these type of users try to book or write a review, they will be redirected to the login page.

---

### As a returning user: 
+ *I want to be able to log into my account.*

As long as the user has been through the registration process, they are redirected to login page to access their account with a flush message:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-06-a.png)

or if the user has already a registered acount, they can use the login page from the navigation bar to access the login form:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-04.png)

If they use the wrong username, they will be informed and can retry:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-06-b.png)

If they use the wrong  password, they will be informed and can retry:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-06-c.png)

And if both username and password are correct, users are redirected to the Home page with a greeting message includes their first name:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-06-d.png)

---

+ *I want to be able to see all my orders(Appointments).*

Users can reach to the order page from the navigation bar, plus buttons in services section in home page, service page and footer link:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-07.png)

Once they have clicked it, they will be redirected to the order page:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-08.png)

---
+ *I want to have ease of access to any orders that I have already booked.*

From their order page, the user will be able to view all orders that they have requested:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-09.png)

---

+ *I want to be able to add a service order (appointment).*

Once the user has been directed to the order page, by clicking the button "add a new appointment", the form of order will be shown up:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-10-a.png)

If the user need recovery services, two more rows will be pop up and they are required to be filled:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-10-b.png)

---


+ *I want to be able to edit or cancel any orders that I have already booked.*

When the new order is booked the new row will be added to the orders. From there, the user can click on any of the orders and they are presented with the order information and also edit and cancel options:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-11.png)

**EDIT Order:**
if the user presses the edit button, the page reloads to the edit page which is a visual duplication of the order page. However, the input fields will be populated with their original input:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-12.png)

Once the user has made the necessary changes, they can confirm them at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, they can cancel all changes they've made. Both buttons lead back to their order page:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-13.png)

**Cancel Order:** if the user chooses the Cancel button, the user has to describe the cancelation reason and then cancel it. they will be presented with a modal to either confirm or cancel the cancelation: 

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-14.png)

---

### As the site owner/admin:

+ The admin will be able to log into their account as every other user does 

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-15.png)

+ *I want to be able to add new Services to the site.*

Once they're on the 'Services' page, they'll have access to the 'Add A New Service' button:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-16.png)

Once they click that, they'll be redirected to the upload page where they can fill in all of the service information. The tool tips will give them information about the input elements:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-17.png)

Once all of the inputs have been filled in correctly, the user can use the 'Add Collection' button at the bottom of the page to add it to the database:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-18.png)

---

+ *I want the new collection to be added to the appropriate site areas.*

The new collection is added to the nav bar (and side nav):

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-19.png)

The new collection is added to the home page carousel:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-20.png)

The new collection has its own page created:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-21.png)

---

+ *I want to be able to edit the pre-existing collections.*

From the 'Manage Collections' page, the admin can hover/click on whichever collection they wish to edit and click the 'Edit' button:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-22.png)

This will redirect them to the edit page where they can update whatever information they want. The only thing they can't update is the collection name:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-23.png)

Once the user has updated the information, they can access they buttons at the bottom of the form. If they click 'Edit Collection', the changed will be sent to the database and be updated across the site. They also have the option to 'Cancel' which will ignore any changes and redirect them to the 'Manage Collections' page:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-24.png)

---

+ *I want to be able to delete any collections.*

From the 'Manage Collections' page, the admin can hover/click on whichever collection they wish to edit and click the 'Delete' button:

![testing from user stories](static/images/README/Testing/testing-25.png)

A modal will appear asking the admin to confirm that they want to delete the collection. They also have the option to 'Cancel' which will close the modal with no changes made:

## Bugs and Fixes

### **Carousel Text**

I used the Materialize Carousel for the home page and wanted to have the information collection name text appear over the image. However, no matter what CSS I tried to manipulate it, the text remained below the image:

![carousel bug](static/images/README/bugs/carousel-bug.PNG)
![carousel bug](static/images/README/bugs/carousel-code.PNG)

On their site, Materialize have another type of carousel that allows for this but I prefer the look of this - the 3d style rotation, in my opinion, looked a lot better for this project. 

I had to experiment ALOT with this but found that the below code worked great for this: 

![carousel bug](static/images/README/bugs/carousel-code-fix-01.PNG)

The above HTML with some CSS tricks helped place the text nicely over the image:

![carousel bug](static/images/README/bugs/carousel-fix.PNG)

Once I had the placement figured, I wanted to experiment further and try to create the carousel dynamically for each drinks collection. While the image and text for each element was easy enough to work through, the anchor URL proved to be tricky. I tried a couple of things and ended up with varying results: 

```<a class="carousel-item" href="{{ url_for(category.category_name) }}">```
+ This threw and error because the category name was capitalized

```<a class="carousel-item" href="{{ url_for(category.category_name).lower() }}">```
+ Worked for some of the categories but a couple of them have more than one word titles so threw another error.

In the end, I created a ```key:value``` pair in MongoDB: the key was called ```page_url``` and the value matched the name of the html page to be redirected to. I was able to pull that in the HTML code:

![carousel bug](static/images/README/bugs/carousel-code-fix-02.PNG)

I have since changed how the collections pages are created - they are now dynamically created so the ```page_url``` is no longer needed.

### **Card Overlaying**

![card overlay bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-01.PNG)

When initially putting together the card layout, I was having an issue where the recipe card was layering on top of the previous one rather than generating it's own card

![card overlay bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-01-code.PNG)

After a bit of experimenting, I moved the entire card div into the for loop and managed to sort this issue. 

![card overlay bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-01-code-fix.PNG)

### **TypeError - length vs count()**

I followed the CI task manager project for the initial stages of this project. Most things translated well except the ```length``` property. When called, it would cause a TypeError.

![TypeError](static/images/README/bugs/bug-02.PNG)

![TypeError](static/images/README/bugs/bug-02-code-2.PNG)

![TypeError](static/images/README/bugs/bug-02-code.PNG)

I did a lot of research on this and while there were a few different fixes, the one that worked best for this project was to change the ```recipes``` variable from a list and use the ```count()``` function instead.

### **Side Nav Dropdown**

When using the Materialize navigation bar dropdown, the side nav dropdown on mobile was covering the content below, rather than pushing the content down. 

![Dropdown bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-03.PNG)

I believe this is expected behaviour but from a UX standpoint, I wasn't happy with this on mobile.
As a result, I decided that it would be a better idea to use a Materialize collapsible on the side-nav instead. This allows the sub-menu to reposition all of the other elements rather than them being covered. 

---
### **Hover on Mobile**

I added ```hover:true``` to the dropdown menu which worked fine on desktop. But with mobile, it was causing a massive glitch - when you would click the dropdown menu, it would appear for a split second and disappear. 

![Hover bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-04-code.PNG)

I tried removing the ```inDuration``` and ```outDuration``` but it was still happening. I decided to remove the ```hover``` option altogether and this fixed the issue. 

---
### **Deleting from Modal**

For defensive programming, I added a modal to the delete button for user confirmation. However, regardless of which recipe was selected to delete, it was always the first recipe on screen that would be deleted. 

After talking to someone on slack who had experienced the same issue, I was informed that there needed to be a direct link between the modal and the element to be deleted. 

I updated the recipe-side modal href and the actual modal ID to target the specific recipe card to be deleted.

### **Selecting option on mobile**

On mobile, the 'Choose Collection' option in both add and edit recipe wasn't working as it should. There was an issue with selecting the options - you would select 'Fruity', but 'Mocktails' would highlight, as if there had been an upwards shift in the selection area. 

![Selecting bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-06-code.PNG) 

Originally the ```formSelect()```m function was placed above the ```dropdown()``` function, both of which were triggered by the 'Choose Collection' dropdown. I know that the order of code matters so I tried to reorder them.

![Selecting bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-06-code-fix.PNG)  

This fixed the issue.

### **Pagination in Categories Pages**

When visiting a specific collection of recipes, the correct recipes for that category were displaying. However, the pagination information was displaying the total number of recipes in the database. 

![Pagination bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-09.jpg)

![Pagination bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-09-code.PNG)

Because I hadn't specified the ```category_name``` in the ```find()``` function for the ```total``` variable, it was counting all recipes and then displaying this number as the total. 

![Pagination bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-09-code-fix.PNG)

Adding the ```category_name``` key and the correct value in the ```total``` variable fixed the issue.

Since then, the code has been refactored but the theory remains the same:

``` 
recipes = mongo.db.recipes.find({"category_name": category["category_name"]})

total = recipes.count()
```

### **Input Field Dynamic ID**

When dynamically adding a new input field for ingredients and method, there was an issues with clicking the input field. When the second input was clicked, the focus would jump back up to the original input. 

![Input Field Dynamic ID bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-10.PNG)

This was because I had not been dynamically adding a new ID to the newly created input fields. Adding an incrementing variable to the ID fixed this issue.

### **Unbalanced Tuple Unpacking**

A pylint warning appeared when I added the pagination functionality:

![Unbalanced Tuple Unpacking bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-12.PNG)

This was a non-issue as everything was working as it should, and the code worked fine.

After a bit of research I learned that this is referred to as a 'false positive' and by adding the below comment, the warning would go away: 

![Unbalanced Tuple Unpacking bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-12-code-fix.PNG)

### **Scroll-To-Top TypeError**

I added a button to redirect the user back to the top of the page when they had scrolled for a certain amount of pixels. But because the button isn't present on all pages, the JS script was looking for it, not finding it and then throwing the error:

![Scroll-To-Top TypeError bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-13.PNG)

Wrapping the whole button functionality inside an if statement allowed the script to check if the button was on that page and either run the functions if it was, and ignore them if it wasn't.

 On mobile display, a particularly long or multiple word heading

Making the font responsive to the view width allowed for longer text to display properly without overflowing off the screen. I used a media query targeted specifically at smaller screens so the desktop display didn't look oversized.

### **Dynamic Input Pattern Attribute**

When I added the ```pattern=".*\S+.*"``` attribute to the dynamically created input fields, they weren't rendering through to HTML correctly. It was rendering as ```pattern=".*S+.*"```, omitting the backslash. 

To counter this, I added an extra backslash: ```pattern=".*\\S+.*"``` and this solved the issue.

### **Ingredients list issue**

Not so much of a bug but an issues that needed to be addressed. I had friends upload recipes to test. One of the issues that came from this was them not adding to the fields following the instructions in the tool tips. 

There's an input for the main ingredient which is displayed on the recipe card but this also needs to be input under the ingredients list (preferably with measurements). It says this in the tooltips but I get that people don't always read them. 

The issue was that while the main ingredient was seen on the recipe card, once you viewed the full recipe, that was omitted:

To fix this, I added the ```main_ingredient``` to the recipe list. This worked well for recipes that had omitted it from the main ingredients list:

But on a recipe that had all of the ingredients listed as per the instructions, it looked a bit strange for it to be listed twice:

To try to remedy the issues, I decided to meet somewhere in the middle - I enlarged the ```main_ingredient``` font and made it a little bolder:

This way it's included on the ingredients list but looks more like a featured ingredient that can be overlooked if that ingredient is listed elsewhere.

## Known Bugs

### **URL & Username bug**

When testing error pages, I was adding addition characters to the end of the URL in the account page, anything that was changed/edited was updating the username header on the page:

I defined username as a variable in the account section of the app.py file:

I retested and, while it solved that issue, adding the extra characters didn't break the code. This is an issue that hasn't been resolved.

### **Passive Event Handler**

From the Chrome console there are issues being reported: 

![URL & Username bug](static/images/README/bugs/bug-15.PNG)

These are coming from the ```.side-nav``` and ```.carousel``` triggers. Based on the message itself, the issue seems to be coming from Materialize rather than the script.js file.

However, I spent a lot of time looking into this and trying to add the ```passive: true``` that the helper documentation pointed to but to no avail.
